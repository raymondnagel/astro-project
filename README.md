# astro-project
An incomplete spaceship game that I made as personal project.
Fully functional; however, at this point there is no real goal and no way to win.
A MIDI exception may occur, which I haven't had time to look into; but it doesn't seem to affect execution in any noticeable way.

This is a complete Java project (though the game itself is incomplete) which can be loaded into the latest NetBeans IDE. It can also be run by executing the Astro.jar or Astro.bat (Windows) file in the 'dist' directory.

The program runs in full-screen mode.

Controls:
Left/Right arrow keys steer (turn) your ship.
Up arrow turns on engine/accelerates.
Down arrow deccelerates/turns off engine.
Spacebar fires the current weapon.
Ctrl key changes the current weapon.
Shift turns your ship's shield on/off.
Home key toggles aim-path.
Hold down End key to use hyperdrive.
F1 key toggles the information display; use to view ship condition, current weapon, and galaxy map.
F2 key toggles the battery(blue) / hull(red) meters for all ships.
Esc key exits the game.

Play Notes:
- Each ship's battery is consumed by accelerating the engine, firing weapons, and soaking hits using the shield.
- After taking a few hits, most enemy ships will activate their shields. Larger ships have stronger shields and weapons.
- The shield causes hits to decrease the ship's battery rather than damage its hull.
- The ion cannon specializes in destroying enemy shields.
- There is no point to this unfinished game... just fly around and blow stuff up!
- Try not to fly off the map, because you may not be able to find your way back onto the screen!
- Yes, I composed the music myself :-p
